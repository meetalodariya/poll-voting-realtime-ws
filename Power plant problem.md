# Hisui's New Power Plant

1. First, we will calculate the est. amount of electricity that village needs.

    - Population of the village (Diamond and Pearl) is 87. Average usage per residential building per month is around 886 kWh. Total = 87 * 886 ~ 78000 kWh/mo.

    - Usage by buildings (based on size given in wiki):
        - Jubilife TV Station: 9000 kWh/mo.
        - Global Trade Station: 10,000 kWh/mo.
        - Global Wonder Station: 8,000 kWh/mo.
        - Pok√©tch Company: 6000 kWh/mo.
        - Trainers' School: 4000 kWh/mo.
        - Jubilife Condominiums: 7000 kWh/mo.

    - Usage by Public services/infrastructure: 
        - Let's take the average of: 35000 kWh/mo

    - Total: 78000 + 44000 + 35000 ~ 200,000 kWh/mo. (to have surplus in case of disasters/failures)

2. Not a pokemon TV series watcher honestly. But here's my estimated Voltorb power output based on info I could find on the internet.

    - If we assume that Voltorb pokemon acts as LION battery which can store 500-700 Wh/kg, then the total energy that can be stored would be:
        - Total energy = Weight of pokemon x Energy density = 10.4 kg x 500 Wh/kg = 5200 Wh or 5.2 kWh

    - Let's assume that pokemon can only generate this much power per day and after rest/feeding it can generate same power next day. 
        - Total power one Voltorb generate per month = 5.2 * 30 ~ 156 kWh/mo.

3. Calculate the number of pokemons needed to power up the village.          

    - Voltorbs needed = 200000 / 156 = 1282 Voltorbs.


### In conclusion, we may have to catch `1282` Voltorbs to power up the entire Jubilife village.
