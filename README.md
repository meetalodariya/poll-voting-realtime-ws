## Highlights âœ¨

- Entirely written in TypeScript.
- Live data updates using web sockets (subscription based).
- End-to-end testing using cypress.
- Container orchestration with docker-compose.
- Optimized client build for production.

## Getting started

1. First step is to make sure that system has docker installed and running.

   ```
   docker info
   ```

2. Run below command to build and start the app containers from root dir.

   ```
    make up
   ```

   This will build `api`, `client` and pull `mongo` image from registry and boot up all the containers. After that, the url of web `client` will be opened in default browser.

3. Once all the container are up and running, open [http://localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080) in browser if not opened automatically.

- To remove/shutdown the containers:

  ```
  make down
  ```

- For MongoDB admin UI, starts at port [8081](http://localhost:8081):

  ```
  make up_mongo_admin
  ```

- To run end-to-end test cases:

  ```
  make run_e2e
  ```

- To open cypress suite:

  ```
  make open_e2e_suite
  ```
